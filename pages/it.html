            <h2>It</h2>
            <p>"It" (original title: "It") is a 2017 American horror film directed by Andy Muschietti and written based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. The film also has a 1990 TV miniseries adaptation, but the 2017 version is the first part of a re-adapted film trilogy.
                The story takes place in the small town of Derry, where a group of young people, members of the "Losers' Club", try to solve mysterious murders and disappearances in the town. They soon discover that an evil and mysterious entity, in the form of Pennywise the clown, is responsible for these horrors. The kids must face their own fears and demons as they try to stop Pennywise and save the town.
                "Az" is an excellently designed and directed horror film that received rave reviews and audience appreciation. The film's dark atmosphere, stunning visual effects and strong characters provide viewers with a fascinating experience. Pennywise, the clown, is particularly shocking and terrifying, and Bill Skarsg√•rd's performance makes him one of the best horror movie monsters.
