            <h2>The Shining</h2>
            <p>"The Shining" (original title: "The Shining") is a 1980 American horror film directed and written by Stanley Kubrick. The film is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name and is considered one of the most influential and iconic horror films in later years.
                At the heart of the story is Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer who works as a supervisor at the abandoned Overlook Hotel with his family when winter comes. As time passes, Jack becomes increasingly isolated and mentally unstable, until he finally descends into a dangerous madness inspired by the hotel and its dark past.
                The slowly building, tense atmosphere of "The Shining", the iconic soundtrack and the hauntingly stunning visual styles all contribute to the film's legendary status. Jack Nicholson's amazing portrayal of the male character, who plunges to the depths of madness, has become emblematic in the history of horror films.
                 is a film recognized by critics and a favorite of the audience, which has acquired cult status over the years. Because of the work of Stanley Kubrick and the psychological depth of the film, as well as the iconic scenes and dialogues, "The Shining" is still considered one of the most defining and frightening horror films today.
