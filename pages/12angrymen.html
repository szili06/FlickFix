            <h2>12 Angry Men</h2>
            <p>"12 Angry Men" (original title: "12 Angry Men") is a 1957 American drama directed by Sidney Lumet. The film is based on a short novel written by Reginald Rose, which was later adapted for the dramatic stage.
                At the heart of the story is a judicial jury that must make a decision in the trial of a young man accused of murder. However, among the 12 jurors, there are doubts about the young man's guilt, and none of them is ready to convict him immediately. One of the jurors, played by Henry Fonda, slowly convinces the others to consider the case carefully and not make a hasty decision.
                "12 Angry Men" takes place in an exceptional way in a single location, in a narrow and hot jury room, where the tension and conflicts between the jurors are increasing. The film is an excellent presentation of human characters, prejudices and moral dilemmas as the truth is gradually revealed throughout the plot.
                "12 Angry Men" was a critical success and was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film has achieved cult status over the decades and is considered by many to be the best courtroom drama in film history. Because of the depth of the characters, the excellent script and the exciting plot, "12 Angry Men" is still worth watching and studying today.
