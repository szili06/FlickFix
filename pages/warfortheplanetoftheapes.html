            <h2>Planet of the apes</h2>
            <p>"Planet of the Apes" (original title: "Planet of the Apes") is a 1968 American science fiction film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. The film is based on the novel "La Plan√®te des Singes" by Pierre Boulle. The story follows the adventures of a team of astronauts who arrive on an alien planet, the Planet of the Apes, where apes are the ruling race, while humans live as primitive and slavelike people.
                The film examines social and political themes while portraying the conflict between the dominant apes and humans. During the story, the human protagonist, George Taylor (Charlton Heston), and his companions fight for their lives and the dignity of human existence in a world dominated by apes.
                "Planet of the Apes" had a significant impact on the science fiction genre and cinema in general. The film has inspired several sequels, television series, spin-offs and reimaginings over the years. The original "Planet of the Apes" has since achieved cult status and is considered by many to be one of the most outstanding and influential science fiction films ever made.
